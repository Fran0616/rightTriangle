# rightTriangle
#this code will take user input from a right triangle and solve the area of the triangle

A right triangle consist of three side. Two legs and an hypotenuse. This code will take the value of two legs from user and find the hypotenuse. 

Formula - The formula for calculating a right truangle is 

**Variable**

legA - This variable is the first leg and will store the value for that leg

legB - This varaibles holds the value for the second leg. 

**Function** 
str() - This function cinverts valurs into a string. In this code it will work with the print function to calculate the hypotenus of a given right triangle. 

**str()**
The formula will square legA and legB, then calculate the sum and finaly the sum will be raise to the power of .5 and this will gove you the result.
